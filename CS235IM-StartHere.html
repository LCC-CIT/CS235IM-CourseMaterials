    <h1> Welcome to iOS App Development!</h1>
    <h2>Start Here</h2>
    <br>
    Some of you are taking the online section of this course and others
    are in the on-campus section, either way you will use this same
    Moodle page. Regardless of the section you are in, you are welcome
    to either: <br>
    <ul>
      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come to class on campus</li>
      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participate remotely in a live stream using
        Zoom</li>
      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Watch a video recording. There will be
        links in each weekâ€™s Moodle module for the live streams and
        recordings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You must have access to a Mac or Windows computer that can run
      Visual Studio with the Xamarin iOS extensions and have a good
      internet connection to participate in this class. If you use a
      Windows computer, you need to be able to connect to a Mac in order
      to build and run your apps (you can design the UI and write code
      without a Mac). <br>
    </p>
    <p>In order to be successful in this class, you must devote at least
      12 hours a week to learning activities. This includes 4 hours
      participating in class (or Zoom live streams, or recordings), and
      at least 8 hours studying and working on your own.<br>
      <br>
      Next, read the <a
href="https://lcc-cit.github.io/CS235IM-CourseMaterials/CS235IM_Syllabus.html"
        target="_blank">syllabus</a> and finally click on the first
      section title on the main Moodle page, Creating Your First Android
      App, to open that section and then we can start have fun writing
      apps!<br>
