    <h1> Welcome to iOS App Development!</h1>
    <h2>Start Here</h2>
    <br>
    Some of you are taking the online section of this course and others
    are in the on-campus section. Regardless of the section you are in,
    you are welcome to either: <br>
    <ul>
      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come to class on campus</li>
      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participate remotely in a live stream using
        Zoom</li>
      <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Watch a video recording. There will be
        links in each weekâ€™s Moodle module for the live streams and
        recordings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You must have access to a Mac or Windows computer that can run
      Visual Studio with the Xamarin iOS extensions and have a good
      internet connection to participate in this class. If you use a
      Windows computer, you need to be able to connect to a Mac in order
      to build and run your apps (you can design the UI and write code
      without a Mac). <br>
    </p>
    <p>In order to be successful in this class, you must devote at least
      12 hours a week to learning activities. This includes 4 hours
      participating in class (or Zoom live streams, or recordings), and
      at least 8 hours studying and working on your own.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>Online Course Communication</h2>
    <p>All course communication (via e-mail, Moodle Messages, discussion
      forums, video chat, etc.) should be clear, concise, and
      respectful. Written communication should use complete sentences
      with standard spelling and grammar, including proper
      capitalization and punctuation.<br>

      Questions about the course should be posted to the Course Q &amp;
      A Forum. Questions of a more personal nature, such as grades or
      extensions, should be sent to your instructor via e-mail. E-mails
      to your instructor or e-mails to another department regarding
      support issues should include your course number and section.<br>
      <br>
      All course announcements will be posted by the instructor to the
      News and Announcements Forum. Students are expected to check the
