### Learning Resources

#### Optional Textbook 

*Beginning iPhone Development with Swift 4*, *Exploring the iOS SDK*, Fourth Edition 
by Molly K. Maskrey
Apress 2017
ISBN for eBook: 978-1-4842-3072-5, for softcover: 978-1484230718
More information and additional resources are available on the [publisher's web site](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484230718).

#### Xamarin Tutorials 

The main learning resource will be developer tutorials provided on the [Xamarin Web site](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/).

#### Learning Management System

All of the course resources and activities will be managed through course pages hosted on [LCC's Moodle site](https://classes.lanecc.edu/). 

#### Apple Macs and iPads for Development

Xamarin iOS development can be done on either a Windows PC or an Apple Mac, but a Mac is required for compilation and testing of the app. Here are the computing resources available for your use at LCC:

- **Classroom**: Apple iMac computers and iPad Mini tablets are available for student use in the classroom. 
  (Students may also bring their own notebook computers and iPhones or iPads to class.)
- [CIT Computer Lab](file:///Volumes/DataCard/Repos/CS235IM-CourseMaterials/lanecc.edu/cit/computer-lab): Apple iMacs with the software required for the lab work are available. The lab is located in building 19, room 135. 
- **Cloud Mac Service**: Alternatively, you may use a remote virtual Mac from a service like [MacInCloud](http://macincloud.com), with an academic price plan starting at $16 a month.

#### Software

##### Software for Developing iOS Apps

We will use Visual Studio for developing iOS apps. Visual Studio is available for Mac OS. [Visual Studio for Mac](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/mac/) or [Visual Studio Community Edition for Windows](https://www.xamarin.com/download) can be downloaded from Microsoft free of cost.

Alternatively, you may use [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), which runs on Windows, Mac OS, or Linux. Rider is available free of charge to students. You can use Rider in the same way you would use Visual Studio except that Rider does not include a UI Designer, so you would need to use the UI designer in XCode on a Mac for that part of your development work.

**Important Note**: If you use Visual Studio on Windows or Rider on Windows or Linux, you will still need to connect to a Mac that is running XCode via a local network or over the Internet in order to do builds and run an iOS simulator. You can use an actual Mac or a service like MacInCloud for this.

##### General Purpose Software

- **Word processing software**: options include MS Office, OpenOffice.org or GoogleDocs for viewing and editing office documents
- **A code editor**: Visual Studio Code is a free editor that can be downloaded via the internet and used on Windows, OS X (Mac) or Linux. Alternatively, you can use TextWrangler on OS X, or Notepad++ on Windows. 
- [Git distributed version control](https://git-scm.com): you will need to use Git to clone repositories containing lab starter code and demonstration app code. 

##### Free and Discounted Software for Students

- **Azure Dev Tools for Teaching** (previously known as Microsoft Imagine Premium) is a subscription-based offering, paid for by the CIT department, providing access to professional development and design tools, software, and services from Microsoft. 
- [On The Hub](https://lanecc.onthehub.com/WebStore/ProductsByMajorVersionList.aspx?cmi_mnuMain=f189368a-f0a6-e811-8109-000d3af41938) has partnered with Microsoft, Adobe, IBM, Symantec, VmWare and other software publishers to offer discounted and free software for students and faculty.

#### CIT Computer Lab

The CIT Main lab (Bldg. 19, room 135) is equipped with computers which are available exclusively for students in the CIT department. There are tutors available in the lab to help you with your lab work. There is a schedule is posted on the large white board inside the lab which lists the tutors and the times they will be available.



### Career Pathway Certificate 

The following courses are required to earn a [Career Pathway Certificate in Mobile Application Development](http://oregon.ctepathways.org/c/post/2338/lcc-mobile-application-development-career-pathway.html):

- CS133N, Beginning Programming: C#
- CS233N, Intermediate Programming: C#
- CS235AM, Intermediate Mobile Application Development: Android
- CS235IM, Intermediate Mobile Application Development: iOS

A [Career Pathway](https://www.lanecc.edu/pathways) is a series of connected courses that lead to a job or help a student advance in a career.

### Learning Activities 

#### Lab Assignments

These are programing projects that you will do on your own- either using the computers and software in the CIT lab, or using your own computer and software. Students will submit both a beta version and a release version of the software solution for each lab assignment. The beta version should be essentially complete. "Complete" means having working code that fulfill all the core requirements for the assignment, but it does not need to be bug free. The release version should fulfill all requirements and be bug fee.

#### Code Reviews

Students will work in class, in groups of two or three, to review the beta version of each other's lab assignment solutions. The reviewers will evaluate coding practices as well as the functionality of each software solution. Students will use input from the code review to revise their code prior to submitting the release version of their software solution.

#### Quizzes

Weekly quizzes are given over the reading and exercises in the textbook as a way to focus students on the most important concepts in textbook chapters covered. 

#### Term Project

The requirements for the term project will be presented during the first week of class.



### Assessment and Grading

Specific grading criteria will be applied to each of the labs, quizzes, and exams you will be working on in this class. Part of the lab involves a code review. Attendance is not graded.
The table below summarizes the grade distribution for each of the assessment tasks:



| Assessment Activities | **Number** | Percentage |
| --------------------- | :--------: | ---------- |
| Lab assignments       |     8      | 40%        |
| Code Reviews          |     8      | 10%        |
| Quizzes               |     8      | 10%        |
| Term Project          |     1      | 40%        |


Letter grades for the course will be determined by the following percentages:        

|      | -        |         | +       |
| ---- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| A    | 90 - 91  | 92 - 97 | 98-100  |
| B    | 80 - 81  | 82 - 87 | 88 - 89 |
| C    | 70 - 71  | 72 - 77 | 78 - 79 |
| D    | 60 - 61  | 62 - 67 | 68 - 69 |
| F    | Below 60 |         |         |



#### Late Work

- Lab drafts (beta versions) may not be submitted after the due date. 
- Code reviews and lab release versions submitted after the due date will be reduced by 10%
- Quizzes and exams cannot be taken after the due date.

Exceptions will only be made for serious illness or emergency situations. 



#### Academic Honesty

While students are encouraged to discuss labs and to use each other as resources, each student is responsible for his/her own work. In other words you can help each other, but you can't copy any part of someone else's work. The end product must be each student's own individual work.



#### Attendance

Since this is a hybrid on-campus/online class, attendance is optional, but to succeed, you must engage in the lectures and participate in class activities either online or in the classroom.



#### Weekly Learning Activities

Monday

- Complete a review of last week's lab work for your lab partner
- Come to class, participate in the live stream, or watch the recording 

Tuesday (except weeks with a holiday on Monday)
