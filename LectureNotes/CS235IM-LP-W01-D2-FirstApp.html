    <h2><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>iOS App Architecture</h2>
    <h4>MVC</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Model: A class or set of complex classes that just hold data</li>
      <li>View: Just presents the information (like a web page)</li>
      <li>Controller: Responds to user input and does processing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Show students the completed PhoneWord app. Give a tour of the
      parts of the app and relate them to the MVC architecture.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Visual Studio Project Tour<br>
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>References - Contains the assemblies required to build and run
        the application.</li>
      <li>Packages - The Packages directory contains ready-made NuGet
        packages.</li>
      <li>Resources - The Resources folder stores other media.</li>
      <li>Main.cs – This contains the main entry point of the
        application.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>AppDelegate.cs – This file contains the main application class
        and is responsible for creating the Window, building the user
        interface, and listening to events from the operating system.</li>
      <li>Main.storyboard - The Storyboard contains the visual design of
        the application’s user interface.</li>
      <li>ViewController.cs – The View Controller powers the screen
        (View) that a user sees and touches. The View Controller is
        responsible for handling interactions between the user and the
        View. It is a subclass of UIViewController.<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>ViewController.designer.cs – The designer.cs is an
          auto-generated file that serves as the glue between controls
          in the View and their code representations in the View
          Controller. Because this is an internal plumbing file, the IDE
          will overwrite any manual changes and most of the time this
          file can be ignored.&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Info.plist – The Info.plist is where application properties
        such as the application name, icons, launch images, and more are
        set.</li>
      <li>Entitlements.plist - The entitlements property list lets us
        specify application capabilities (also called App Store
        Technologies) such as iCloud, PassKit, and more.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Storyboard and Views<br>
    </h2>
    <h3>Storyboard</h3>
    <p>A storyboard contains:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Scenes - representations of an application's screens which
        each consist of<br>
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>A View Controller</li>
        <li>A stack of views (the <span style="font-style: italic;">Content
            View Hierarchy</span>) which are managed by the View
          Controller<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Segues - transitions between scenes</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The first one is called a <span style="font-style: italic;">sourceless
            segue</span></li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>View Life-cycle<span style=" font-style: italic;"></span></h3>
    <h3><span style=" font-style: italic;"></span></h3>
    The operating system notifies the View Controller of events in the
    View life-cycle by calling methods in the UIViewController base
    class. By overriding these methods, you can interact with the view
    objects in the scene.<br>
    <br>
    These are the basic lifecycle methods:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>ViewDidLoad - Called once the first time the View Controller
        loads its Content View Hierarchy into memory. This is a good
        place to do initial setup because it is when Subviews first
        become available in code.</li>
      <li>ViewWillAppear - Called every time a View Controller's View is
        about to be added to a Content View Hierarchy and appear on the
        screen.</li>
      <li>ViewWillDisappear - Called every time a View Controller's View
        is about to be removed from a Content View Hierarchy and
        disappear from the screen. This lifecycle event is used for
        cleanup and saving state.</li>
      <li>ViewDidAppear and ViewDidDisappear - Called when a View gets
        added or removed from the Content View Hierarchy, respectively.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>

    </span>
    <ul>
      <li>XCode needs to be up to date and working (even though you are
